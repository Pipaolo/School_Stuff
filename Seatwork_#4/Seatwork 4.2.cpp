Problem: 3

There are some techniques that Mathematician use to know if a number is divisible by another number. Some rules are stated below.

2	The last digit of the number must be divisible by 2.
3	The sum of the digits when added must be divisible by 3 (works for at least 2 digit numbers).
5	The last digit must end with 0 or 5.

With the rules above, write a program that allow a user to enter a numeric value higher than 9 and less than 10,000 (maximum of 4 digits only) and will identify if that number is divisible by 2, 3 and/or 5.
